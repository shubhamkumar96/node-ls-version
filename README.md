        (chmod +x index.js) 
##### 2) Add below comment at top of "index.js" file to allow it to be treated as an executable.
        (#!/usr/bin/env node)
##### 3) Execute in terminal(as an admin) after going inside the project directory [This is used to link our project to make it available         globally everywhere else.] :
